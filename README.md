# Diabetic-Retinopathy
# Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

## üìå Project Overview
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness if not detected early. Traditional diagnosis requires expert ophthalmologists to review retinal fundus images, which is time-consuming and limited in scalability.  

This project presents a **hybrid deep learning model** that integrates:
- **EfficientNetB0 (CNN)** ‚Üí extracts fine-grained local features like microaneurysms and hemorrhages.  
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)** ‚Üí captures global dependencies and structural patterns across retinal images.  

By combining **10% EfficientNet + 90% Vision Transformer**, the model achieves high accuracy in DR severity classification.  

An interactive **web application** (Flask backend + React frontend) is also developed, allowing users to upload retinal images and receive real-time predictions of DR severity.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- Hybrid CNN + Transformer architecture for **robust DR detection**  
- **APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Dataset** used for training & evaluation  
- Supports classification into **5 severity levels**:
  - 0 ‚Üí No_DR  
  - 1 ‚Üí Mild  
  - 2 ‚Üí Moderate  
  - 3 ‚Üí Severe  
  - 4 ‚Üí Proliferative_DR  
- Data preprocessing with **augmentation, normalization, and class balancing**  
- Evaluation using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC**  
- Flask-React **web interface** for real-time predictions
